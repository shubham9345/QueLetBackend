<h1>QueLet</h1> 
QueLet is a virtual queue management system designed to streamline appointment processes in healthcare facilities. By enabling users to join queues online, it eliminates the need for physical waiting lines. Once registered, users receive a QR code that must be presented to the hospital management upon arrival for quick verification and smooth service delivery.
